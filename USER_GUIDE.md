### Creating a Child Account

```sql
INSERT INTO users (openId, name, email, role, parentId, grade, totalPoints, currentStreak, longestStreak)
VALUES ('child-unique-id', 'Your Son Name', 'child@email.com', 'child', 1, 7, 0, 0, 0);
```

Replace:
- `'child-unique-id'` with a unique identifier
- `'Your Son Name'` with your child's name
- `'child@email.com'` with an email (optional)
- `1` with your parent user ID (check the users table)
