      "correctAnswer": "Law of Inertia",
      "explanation": "Newton's First Law is also called the Law of Inertia because it describes how objects resist changes in their state of motion. An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues moving at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.",
      "detailedExplanation": "### 🎯 Why the Answer is Law of Inertia\n\nThe correct answer is **Law of Inertia** because Newton's First Law describes how objects resist changes in their motion. An object at rest wants to stay at rest, and an object in motion wants to keep moving at the same speed and direction.\n\n### 💡 Understanding Inertia\n\nInertia is like stubbornness! Objects don't like to change what they're doing. The more mass an object has, the more stubborn (more inertia) it is. That's why it's harder to push a heavy truck than a bicycle.\n\n### 🌟 Real-Life Example\n\nImagine you're on a bus that suddenly brakes. Your body lurches forward! Why? Because your body wants to keep moving forward (inertia), even though the bus has stopped. This is Newton's First Law in action.\n\nAnother example: When you pull a tablecloth quickly from under dishes, the dishes stay in place because of inertia - they resist the sudden change in motion.\n\n### 📚 Key Takeaway\n\nRemember: **Inertia = resistance to change in motion**. Objects need a force to start moving, stop moving, or change direction. Without a force, they just keep doing what they were doing!",

      "correctAnswer": "6 N",
      "explanation": "Using Newton's Second Law (F = ma), we calculate: Force = mass × acceleration = 2 kg × 3 m/s² = 6 N. This law shows the direct relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.",
      "detailedExplanation": "### 🎯 Why the Answer is 6 N\n\nThe correct answer is **6 N** because we use Newton's Second Law: **F = ma** (Force = mass × acceleration).\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Mass (m) = 2 kg\n- Acceleration (a) = 3 m/s²\n- Force (F) = 2 kg × 3 m/s² = **6 N**\n\n### 💡 Understanding F = ma\n\nNewton's Second Law tells us that the force needed depends on two things:\n1. **How heavy** the object is (mass)\n2. **How quickly** you want to speed it up (acceleration)\n\nMore mass OR more acceleration = more force needed!\n\n### 🌟 Real-Life Example\n\nThink about pushing a shopping cart. An empty cart (less mass) is easy to push and speed up. But a full cart (more mass) needs much more force to accelerate at the same rate!\n\nSimilarly, if you want to make a skateboard speed up quickly (high acceleration), you need to push harder (more force) than if you just want it to speed up slowly.\n\n### 📚 Key Takeaway\n\nRemember: **F = ma**. To find force, multiply mass by acceleration. The unit of force is Newton (N), which equals kg⋅m/s².",

      "detailedExplanation": "### 🎯 Why the Answer is Newton's Third Law\n\nThe correct answer is **Newton's Third Law** because it states: \"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"\n\nWhen you push the wall (action), the wall pushes you back with equal force (reaction). These forces are always equal in strength but opposite in direction.\n\n### 💡 Understanding Action-Reaction Pairs\n\nAction-reaction pairs always involve **two objects**:\n- You push the wall → Wall pushes you\n- Earth pulls you down → You pull Earth up\n- Rocket pushes gas backward → Gas pushes rocket forward\n\nThey're equal in strength but opposite in direction, and they act on different objects!\n\n### 🌟 Real-Life Example\n\nWhen you jump, you push down on the ground (action), and the ground pushes you up (reaction) - that's why you go up!\n\nWhen you swim, you push water backward with your hands (action), and the water pushes you forward (reaction) - that's how you move through the pool!\n\n### 📚 Key Takeaway\n\nRemember: **Forces always come in pairs**. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. You can't push something without it pushing back!",

      "correctAnswer": "The speed of the moving object",
      "explanation": "Friction depends on the nature and roughness of surfaces in contact and the normal force pressing them together, but it is generally independent of the speed of motion. Whether an object moves slowly or quickly, the friction force remains approximately the same (for kinetic friction).",
      "detailedExplanation": "### 🎯 Why Speed Does NOT Affect Friction\n\nThe correct answer is **the speed of the moving object** because friction is generally independent of how fast something is moving.\n\nWhether you slide a book across a table slowly or quickly, the friction force is about the same! What matters is:\n- **What the surfaces are made of** (rubber on concrete = high friction)\n- **How rough they are** (sandpaper = rough = high friction)\n- **How hard they're pressed together** (normal force)\n\n### 💡 Common Misconception\n\nMany students think faster movement = more friction. But that's not true for most everyday situations! The friction force stays constant whether you're moving at 1 m/s or 10 m/s.\n\n*Note: At very high speeds (like cars at 200 km/h), air resistance becomes important, but that's different from friction between surfaces.*\n\n### 🌟 Real-Life Example\n\nSlide your hand slowly across your desk. Now slide it quickly. The resistance (friction) feels about the same, right? The speed doesn't change the friction force!\n\nBut try sliding your hand on a rough carpet versus a smooth desk. Big difference! That's because the **nature of the surfaces** affects friction.\n\n### 📚 Key Takeaway\n\nRemember: **Friction depends on what surfaces are touching and how hard they're pressed together, NOT on speed**. Rougher surfaces and heavier pressing = more friction!",

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctAnswer": "True",
      "explanation": "According to Newton's First Law, an object moving at constant velocity (constant speed and direction) has balanced forces, meaning the net force is zero. If there were a net force, the object would accelerate according to Newton's Second Law.",
      "detailedExplanation": "### 🎯 Why This is True\n\nThe statement is **True** because of Newton's First Law. When an object moves at constant velocity (same speed, same direction), all forces are balanced - the net force is zero.\n\nIf there was a net force, the object would speed up, slow down, or change direction. Since it's moving at constant velocity, we know the forces are balanced!\n\n### 💡 Understanding Net Force\n\n**Net force** = total of all forces acting on an object\n- Net force = 0 → constant velocity (or at rest)\n- Net force ≠ 0 → acceleration (speed up, slow down, or turn)\n\nConstant velocity means NO acceleration, which means net force must be zero!\n\n### 🌟 Real-Life Example\n\nA car cruising on a highway at steady 60 km/h has zero net force! The engine pushes forward, but air resistance and friction push backward with equal force. They balance out, so the car maintains constant speed.\n\nA book sliding across a table at constant speed (if friction is perfectly balanced by a push) has zero net force too!\n\n### 📚 Key Takeaway\n\nRemember: **Constant velocity = zero net force**. Moving at steady speed in a straight line means all forces are balanced, even though the object is moving!",

      "correctAnswer": "True",
      "explanation": "Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact. Whether an object is moving or trying to move, friction acts in the opposite direction to prevent or slow down that motion. This is why we need to apply force to keep objects moving against friction.",
      "detailedExplanation": "### 🎯 Why This is True\n\nThe statement is **True** because friction always acts in the direction **opposite** to motion (or attempted motion).\n\nIf you push a box to the right, friction pushes to the left. If you try to slide down a slide, friction pushes up. Friction always tries to stop or slow down movement!\n\n### 💡 Understanding Friction\n\nFriction is caused by tiny bumps and grooves on surfaces catching against each other. Even smooth-looking surfaces have microscopic roughness!\n\nTypes of friction:\n- **Static friction** - stops things from starting to move\n- **Kinetic friction** - slows things down while moving\n\nBoth oppose motion!\n\n### 🌟 Real-Life Example\n\nWhen you ride a bike and stop pedaling, you eventually slow down and stop. Why? **Friction** between the tires and road, and air resistance (a type of friction) oppose your motion.\n\nTry sliding a book across your desk. It stops quickly because friction opposes its motion. On ice (very smooth, low friction), it would slide much farther!\n\n### 📚 Key Takeaway\n\nRemember: **Friction always opposes motion**. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, which is why we need to keep applying force to keep things moving!",

      "explanation": "This is false. Rockets work in space by Newton's Third Law. When the rocket expels hot gases backward (action), the gases push the rocket forward (reaction). This doesn't require air - it's an action-reaction pair between the rocket and the expelled gases.",
      "detailedExplanation": "### 🎯 Why This is False\n\nThe statement is **False** because rockets work perfectly in space! They use Newton's Third Law: for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nWhen a rocket shoots hot gases backward (action), those gases push the rocket forward (reaction). No air needed!\n\n### 💡 Common Misconception\n\nMany people think rockets need air to \"push against.\" But that's wrong! Rockets push against the **gases they expel**, not against air.\n\nIn fact, rockets work **better** in space because there's no air resistance to slow them down!\n\n### 🌟 Real-Life Example\n\nImagine you're on a skateboard holding a heavy ball. If you throw the ball backward, you'll roll forward! You didn't push against the ground - you pushed against the ball, and it pushed you back.\n\nThat's exactly how rockets work in space. They \"throw\" hot gases backward at super high speed, and the gases push the rocket forward.\n\nThis is why astronauts can use small gas jets on their spacesuits to move around in space!\n\n### 📚 Key Takeaway\n\nRemember: **Rockets work by Newton's Third Law, not by pushing against air**. They push gas backward, gas pushes rocket forward. This works anywhere, even in the vacuum of space!",
